            This project was created by Aditya Arora as an assignment for the Internshala internship. 
            It is a web application built with (Next.js ,html , Css and Third party app) for frontend and php for backend.

            I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the opportunity to complete the assignment provided by Internshala. As a second-year student, balancing academic responsibilities with extracurricular commitments can often be challenging. Nevertheless, I approached this assignment with enthusiasm and dedication, striving to deliver my best despite the limited time available due to ongoing exams.

While I regret that I wasn't able to implement all the requirements as outlined in the assignment, I am genuinely appreciative of the invaluable learning experience it provided. Through this task, I encountered various challenges that pushed me to expand my problem-solving skills and enhance my understanding of the subject matter. Each obstacle served as a valuable lesson, contributing to my personal and professional growth.
